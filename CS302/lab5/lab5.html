<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 5 (100 pts: Spring 2021)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
Everybody knows about social networks and how they can suggest
people for you to connect with. In this lab, you will write
a simple program for doing that. The point of the exercise
is for you to learn how to create and manipulate a graph.
The assignment is simple, but be forewarned that you 
may run into an obstacle or two. So don't delay, start today.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>

Your friendly TAs will tell you how to submit your work to Canvas.
Do not email your code to the instructor or the TAs as they cannot
upload the code to Canvas for you.
<p>

The files Friendnet1.cpp, Friendnet2.cpp, and Friendnet3.cpp
are due 11:59pm Sunday Mar 14, 2021.
The submitted code must compile and execute without
seg faulting to be graded.
<p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Run the script
/home/cosc302/labs/lab5/copy to obtain
Hydra executables 
sfriendnet1, sfriendnet2, and sfriendnet3,
data file names.txt, skeleton program
Friendnet1.cpp, and a makefile. 
Your job is to write the Friendnet programs and make them behave 
as described next.
<p>

<UL>

<LI>
<b>Friendnet1.cpp</b>: This is your basic program.
Implement the main function to parse the command-line
arguments and terminate with a usage statement unless
the program is called as follows:
<p>

<pre>
unix> cat datafile.txt | Friendnet1 [-seed N]
</pre>

where the square brackets mean that the argument
is optional. If not given, the program should
use time(NULL) to initialize the random number
generator. Otherwise, integer argument N should be 
used.
<p>

Read an unspecified number of strings from stdin into
a vector array (name). Think of the position indices as vertex
identifiers for a graph. The first task is to determine the
edges that connect these vertices (establish who are friends). 
The second task is to determine the set of vertices that 
are two edges away (friends-of-friends aka new friends). 
Declare a 2D vector based array called friends.
Declare another 2D vector based array called new_friends.
Have function set_oldfriends() create friends as a
dense matrix based adjacency table.
Have function set_newfriends() populate new_friends
using this adjacency information.
Finally,
have function writetofile() write the friends data to
a file called doknow1.txt and the new_friends data to
a file called mightknow1.txt.
<p>

Function set_oldfriends() initializes the 2D friends table
to have as many rows as there are entries in the name array.
Then, random friendships are generated for each name. Each
name will be associated with a minimum of one friend (M0=1) 
and a maximum of three friends (M1=3).
The number of edges that need to be generated is thus
M = M0 + rand() % M1.
The friendnet produced is a symmetric graph meaning if there
is an edge between vertices i and j, then
there is also an edge between vertices j and i. As a result,
each vertex may end up being connected to more vertices than
the few defined above. Hint: Use an std::set to produce the edges as
it stores unique instances of the keys inserted -- this helps
prevent multiple identical edges from being produced. Hint: Make
sure a vertex isn't made adjacent to itself. Hint: Use an iterator
based loop to add the std::set edges to the friends table.
<p>

Function set_newfriends() initializes the 2D new_friends table
to have equally many rows as the friends table. A couple of
nested for-loops are then used to determine the friends-of-friends
for each name entry. Hint: Again, make sure a vertex isn't made
a friend-of-a-friend-of-itself. 
<p>

Function writetofile() produces
nicely formatted friends and new_friends output to the above 
mentioned files depending which table is given to it. Determine
the length of the longest name. Use that to set the field width
for each name written. Only write eight names per line. See 
output examples below. When in doubt, run the solution executable
and check its output.

<LI> 
<b>Friendnet2.cpp</b>: Replace the dense 2D-vector-array used
in Friendnet1.cpp with a sparse 2D-vector-array. Modify all
functions as necessary. You may for example want to replace 
many of the index for-loops with iterator loops. Hint: 
The presence of an (i,j) entry indicates
that an edge exists between those vertices. Hint: You may 
need to use the std::sort and std::unique algorithms to 
ensure order and uniqueness of the edges produced. See 
the class12_graph1_handout.pdf code.
The program behavior and output is identical to that of Friendnet1.
<p>

<LI> 
<b>Friendnet3.cpp</b>: Replace the sparse 2D-vector-array used
in Friendnet2.cpp with a binary search tree in the form of
an std::set. Modify all functions as necessary. 
Hint: This is mostly a matter of 
replacing vector with set definitions although a few other
changes are needed. Hint: The std::set supports finding keys.
Hint: As mentioned above, the std::set produces a binary 
search tree holding unique keys -- some of
the extra work needed for the sparse 2D-vector-array can 
thus be removed.
The program
behavior and output is again identical to that of Friendnet1.
<p>

<LI>
To summarize, the three Friendnet programs use
different implementations for the graph that represents the 
social network modeled:
Friendnet1 uses a dense adjacency matrix in the form
of a vector of vectors
where all vectors have the same length; 
Friendnet2 uses a sparse adjacency matrix in the form of
of a vector of variable vectors (lists);
and
Friendnet3 uses a sparse adjacency matrix in the form of
of a vector of sets.
They all achieve the same goal but do so differently.

<h3>Example friendnet1 output</h3>

</pre>

So Olga and Lee know each other. Lee also knows Ginger and David who therefore become potential
new friends for Olga. Same for all the other entries.

The Friendnet2 and Friendnet3 programs produce output identical to the above.
