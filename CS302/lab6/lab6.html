<h1> CS302 -- Lab Assignment 6 (175 pts: Spring 2021)</h1>

<hr>
<h3>Getting motivated</h3>
ACME Shipping needs your help! They have obtained the rights
to ship goods between a number of cities across the world. 
Use your newly acquired knowledge about graphs to write
a program called "citysim" that can tell ACME Shipping 
what the shortest valid route is between any two cities 
in their network.
Being customer friendly, ACME Shipping would like to explore 
two options: (i) a cheap rate based on distance traveled and
(ii) a more expensive rate based on time in transit.
See details below.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Lab submission and due date</h3>

Submit 
Citysim1.cpp by 11:59pm Sunday Mar 21, 2021
followed by
Citysim2.cpp by 11:59pm Sunday Mar 28, 2021.
Each of these programs is broken down into two versions
below. This is merely intended to walk you through the 
process of completing the assignment.
<p>

NOTE: CS307 students will write additional code as outlined
below. CS302 are free to write this code as well but
there is no extra credit to be earned this time.
<p>

<font color="blue">
<b>
Be forewarned that there are many moving parts, 
so you should get started early. 
Whatever you do, make sure you have
code that compiles and does (at least part of) the
job by when each due date rolls around.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

Run the script
/home/cosc302/labs/lab6/copy to obtain
a Hydra executable called scitysim,
city_list.txt (input data),
Citysim1.cpp (skeleton code), 
and a makefile for compiling a Hydra executable
(once properly fleshed out).
Your job is to write the missing source code which must
behave as described next.
<p>

While you have some design freedom,
you must base your code on the classes
and functions listed in Citysim1.cpp and
discussed below.
How you tie things together is up to you.
Also,
floating-point computations should be done
using floats, not doubles. Most math functions
take and produce doubles. That's fine. Feed
them floats and assign the output to floats.
<p>

<b>
Please raise concerns about assignment
inconsistencies or unspoken design criteria on
Piazza sooner rather than later, so that
clarifications can be shared with the class
as early as possible.
</b>
<p>

<h3>Assignment details</h3>

You might find it helpful to take a glance at the 
city_list.txt snippet included below before you continue
reading.
<p>

<UL>
<LI>
<b>Citysim1 Vers 1</b> implements a city class that
stores the name (string), type (string), 
zone (int),
latitude (float), longitude (float) and
population (int). Make these variables
private data members. Add get_variable()
functions for each variable.
Overload the input and output operators to
facilitate
"fin &gt;&gt; city" and 
"fout &lt;&lt; city"
type code. 
The city type is either REGIONAL or GATEWAY. 
We discuss these in more detail below.
<p>

Next, implement function read_cityinfo() which reads
the "city_list.txt" file in the current directory
into a vector&lt;city&gt; array using the overloaded
city input operator.
Empty lines or lines that begin with a hash symbol
(#) should be ignored. 
You may find it convenient to also implement function 
write_cityinfo() which writes the contents of 
the vector&lt;city&gt; array to stdout or an
appropriately named file, so you know you read things
correctly.
See below for example output from the solution code
which produces a file called "city_info.txt".
The name field is 18 characters wide. The type
and population fields are 12 and 10 characters wide,
respectively. The zone is 2 characters wide.
The latitude and longitude fields
are both 8 characters wide and the output is restricted
to two decimal places.
<p>

Note: The latitude and longitude values are
in degrees in city_list.txt and city_info.txt. 
However, your program will need them to be 
in radians for internal use.
Perform the necessary conversion when you
read and write these variables. Recall
that radians=degrees*(pi/180) and
degrees=radians*(180/pi).
<p>

<LI>
<b>Citysim1 Vers 2</b> implements a costtable 
class that computes and contains a table
of distances between all cities and a table
of the time it takes to get from one
city to another.
Since the distance from A to B is the 
same as from B to A, store each of these tables
in a 1D array that holds the diagonal and
lower triangle of the full matrix;
we don't need the diagonal, but including it simplifies
implementation. Say the equivalent 2D table[i][j] is NxN. Then the 1D
table is of size N*(N+1)/2 and you access the elements using
using table[i*(i+1)/2+j] where j &lt;i. You are free to create
two independent tables, but you may find it convenient to
use an array of vectors instead. That is,

<pre>
vector&lt;float&gt; distance_table;
vector&lt;float&gt; time_table;
</pre>

or

<pre>
vector&lt;float&gt; table[2];
</pre>

Either way, create an overloaded function operator that returns the same 
value for costtable(mode,i,j) as for costtable(mode,j,i) by
looking the appropriate value in the 1D array. Here mode refers to
distance (0) or time (1).
Hint: Have the overloaded function operator swap
arguments i and j if i &lt;j before doing a lookup.
Hint: The mode controls whether you look up a distance or a time.
<p>

Use the great-circle distance when computing
the distance between two cities. This
is the shortest distance between them on a sphere
representing the Earth which
we will assume has a radius of 3,982 miles. 
Don't try to be clever and use a more accurate 
radius as it will throw your output off relative to the
solution code.
Also, use the Haversine Formula 
for your computation.
<p>

See 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance"
TARGET="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance</a>
for mathematical details. 
<p>

Round the distances to the nearest 10.0 mile distance. 
This will make it easier to compare your distances with those
produced by the solution code. That is,
set distance = 10.0*round(distance/10.0).
<p>

ACME Shipping has access to a fleet of trucks and ferries that
move goods at an average speed of 60 mph. They also have
access to cargo planes that 
travel at an average speed of 570 mph fully loaded.
The rules for when to ship by ground versus by air are
as follows:
<p>

-- Goods shipped between REGIONAL cities go by ground.
<p>

-- Goods shipped between REGIONAL cities and a GATEWAY city
in the same zone go by air.
<p>

-- Goods shipped between GATEWAY cities go by air no
matter what the zone they are in.
<p>

Add a command line option, namely, 
"-graphinfo" and have it trigger execution of 
functions write_traveldistance() and
write_traveltime() 
which write the contents of the travel cost tables to
files named "city_distancetable.txt" and "city_timetable.txt"
so you know you compute these correctly.
See example output from the solution code below.
<p>

Clean up code and comments, and submit Citysim1.cpp. 
Then create a copy called Citysim2.cpp and continue.

<LI>
<b>Citysim2 Vers 1</b> implements function create_citygraph()
that determines which cities are adjacent to
one another (connected) thereby implicitly creating a
graph. The rules for adjacency are as follows.
<p>

-- A REGIONAL city is adjacent to all other REGIONAL cities 
in the same zone. 
<p>

--A REGIONAL city is also adjacent to the 
nearest GATEWAY city in the same zone.
<p>

-- REGIONAL cities in different zones are not connected.
Instead, their traffic must go thru GATEWAY cities.
<p>

-- A GATEWAY city is adjacent to all other GATEWAY cities
in the same zone. 
<p>

-- A GATEWAY city is also adjacent to the closest
GATEWAY city in another zone, if the distance
is 5,200 miles or less.
<p>

-- In order to make the graph undirected, adjacency is
bidirectional. 
Thus, if A is adjacent to B, then B is also adjacent to A.
This can result in a GATEWAY city becoming connected with
multiple GATEWAY cities in another zone 
(see example below).
<p>

Hint: 
First extract an index list for each type of city.
Then iterate thru these lists following the above
rules. Use the indices to look up the pertinent
information in the vector&lt;city&gt; array discussed
above. Think of these indices as pointers to the data.
<p>

Implement function write_citygraph() 
and have it write the graph to a file called
"city_graph.txt"
so you know you connected the cities correctly.
Update handling of commandline option
"-graphinfo" to trigger execution thereof.
See below for example output from the solution code.
<p>

<LI>
<b>Citysim2 Vers 2</b> 
adds the ability to determine
the shortest path between any two cities
using Dijkstra's algorithm. The output
consists of the sequence of cities from 
source to sink (destination) along with the
incremental and cumulative distances and 
travel times.
This is likely the easiest step of them all.
Embed the code from the Dijkstra code handout.
Add logic to select between use of the
distance and time edge weights you computed earlier.
The algoithm works the same either way but will
produce different answers if the optimal
paths are different. See an example below.
<p>

Update the main program to 
take one of two command-line options:

<pre>
unix> Citysim -distance|time
</pre>

Then have the user input an endless sequence of city pair names
for which the shorted path is reported.
Hint: In order to translate
the names into the indices used internally, have
the read_cityinfo() function create
a map that links the two: "index = map[name]".
This will allow fast lookup of an index given a name. 
<p>

<LI>
<b>The following is optional for CS302 students (no extra credit this time) but
required in order for CS307 students to get full credit.
That is, CS307 students will have up to 20 points deducted
if the functionality described next is not included or doesn't work right. 
</b>
<p>

Add the ability to input just
a partial name, e.g., "Knoxville" or even just "Knox"
for "Knoxville_TN". In case of ambiguity, choose the
city name that follows the partial name in a
lexicographical order, e.g.,
"K" may produce "Kansas_City_KS" instead of
"Knoxville_TN". To be acceptable, this city must
match the search prefix. 
Thus, "Knox" should produce a city that begins with
that, e.g., "KnoxVegas_TN".
Run the solution code to determine the desired behavior.
Your code should function similarly.
Hint: The STL algorithm map::upper_bound() can do
the lookup for you.

As shown above, the solution code accepts city abbreviations for both
shortest path modes.  When multiple cities share the same prefix, 
alphabetical order applies. 
The solution code also accepts wildcards in which case it randomly choses
a city. You can use this feature for source, destination, or both. The
-seed=302 and -seed=307 commandline arguments allow you to reproduce the
random selections should that be of interest. Without either, the program
uses time(NULL) to seed the random number generator making it produce a
different sequence every second (see example above).
