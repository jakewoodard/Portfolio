Why threads?
    1. Asynchrony
    2. Parallelism
    (Huge help in writing an operating system).

What are threads:
   - "Lightweight processors" as opposed to "task", "pod", "heavyweight"
   - Exist in the same memory space, so they share code/globals/heap/stack.
   - Allow the threads to communicate via memory rather than through the OS or with serial
           communication.
   - When you program with threads, you assume that they execute simultaneously.
     Sometimes this is true, and sometimes this is managed via the operating system, and
           sometimes managed internally to the process.
   - generic thread_fork() -> TCB.  generic thread_join(tcb).
   - differentiate fork() and thread_fork().  Differentiate wait() and thread_join().

Posix threads:
   - #include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
   - man pthread_create and pthread_join 
   - write hello world.
   - Forking multiple threads.  print4.c -- Creates four threads.  Passes
         an (int *) to each thread.  Each thread prints its number. 
         Join with all four, and print before and after joining.
         Make sure each (int *) is distinct.

         See if you get multiple outputs with print4.

exit() vs pthread_exit().

   - Modifiy print4 so that all threads call pthread_exit(), including the main thread.
   - Put a pthread_exit() into main before the join calls.  Still runs fine.
   - Now, have all the threads sleep for a second, and have the main thread return.
       Process dead.
   - Change the return back to pthread_exit().
   - Have the threads call exit().

Preemption:

   - Have the main thread go into an infinite loop.  Go over preemption v non-preemption,
     and that most machines these days are by nature preemptive because of multiple CPU's.

Pthread_detach

my first race condition -- do p4bc. and pass &i instead of (ids+i).  If you really want to
confuse them, do it again, but start with print4.c.
