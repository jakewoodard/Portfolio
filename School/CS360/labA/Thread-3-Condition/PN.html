- Talk about the simulation and its overall arc.
- We're going to have a thread per printer and a thread per printer.
- Look at header, talk about driver.
- Parameters:
    - nusers
    - nprinters
    - arrtime
    - maxpages
    - bufsize ------ HIGHLIGH THIS.
    - nevents

- Look at the Spq struct.  Each thread gets the same spq struct, with only
    the id that is different.

- Main thread calls initialize_v (look in header), with a master copy
    of Spq.  You write this.

- User threads -- just talk about what they do.  The main thing is that
    they call submit_job() -- go over a job struct.  This needs to return
    when the job is on the print queue (buffer).  Otherwise, it blocks.

- Printer threads -- again talk about what they do.  They call get_print_job().
    It only returns when there is a job.  Returns NULL when the simulation
    is done.

- Reiterate again what the matin thread does.

- Dummy solution, in src/ps1.c.  Go over running it: 5 3 5 5 3.

- Set up the bounded buffer and write the user code.  Start with
    src/ps2-for-class.c -- that defines the buffer, and initialization.
    Write submit_job() and exit when the buffer is full.  Test.

- Put in the sleep call, and test.
- Write get_print_job and test.
- Bitch about polling.

- Go over monitors and condition variables.  initialize, wait, signal
  (broadcast). Talk about the two-stage waking up and that you want to hold
  the mutex when you call signal, even though you don't have to.  Best to
  unlock it when you're done.

- Now put the code into the simulation.  Maybe just the printers at first.

- Then the users.  Do the "if" statement that has the bug.

- Now the bug.  Show html/bug.html and go over how it happens.
  How could you find this bug?  Well, you'll notice performance suffering.

  It happens in the output (ps4-bad.txt).

  Fix it.
