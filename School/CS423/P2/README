Usage: 
python3 main.py --input filename --start x,y --goal x,y --search BFS|DFS|A*|ALL

Overview:
My program takes in a dat file, a goal point, a start point, and a search method. The input file is a 2D grid of 0's and 1's. 
1 = Wall and 0 = open space. The start and goal points are coordinates. The search methods are breadth-first search, depth-
first search, and a-star search.
